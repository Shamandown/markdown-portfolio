I'm dedicated to my tasks, committed to quality results, and embrace collaborative efforts and my place within them. I'm comfortable taking direction, and taking on leadership when my expertise suits the situation. I have an _author_'s training in peer review and constructive criticism (delivered and recieved) a _technician_'s eye for achieving results, an *engineer*'s eye for what's achievable with the resources on hand, an *artist*'s ability to strive beyond that margin, an *educator*'s drive to help team members perform to their greatest potential, and *soft skills* from years in high-profile customer service.

So far in my coding journey, I've developed skills in (and love for) __Html__, __Javascript__ and __CSS__. I'm still working on finding my focus, but so far my key areas of interest are **Web Development**, **Program and App design** and **Databases**.
