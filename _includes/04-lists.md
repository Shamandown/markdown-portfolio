* Favorite Films:
  1. Fifth Element
  2. You Are Alone
  3. The Impostors
* Favorite kinds of music:
  1. World/punk/rock/jazz fusion.
  2. Funk... which yeah, okay sprawls across soul, RnB, rock, jam, disco, etc... which is all good.
  3. Music that sounds like it's from the past. Also music that sounds like it's from the future. And quite often (every time, technically) music from the past that sounds like it's from the future, which may or may not be in our past.
  4. Metal. Usually I prefer the melodious and symphonic to the brutal and dischordant, except when I don't.
  5. This is all hard to classify. Genrefication is troubling. "Borders are scars on the face of the planet," and also on art. All music is folk music. That is all. (Except music made by non-humans)

* Favorite moments:
  1. Hot day, on my balcony, I'm not in a hurry, and a breeze kicks up and I can just listen to the leaves.
  2. I've been struggling to make something work, (fiction, code, Lego, whatever) brain's all hot twisted wires from the struggle. Attempt, check attempt, check, attempt... and then that moment. Functional result, and it's like cool water flows through my brain.
  3. When I'm reading a book and sink in past the conscious act of reading, and the story just comes fully to life in my mind, supplanting my own reality for a time.
